<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Babatunde Simisola Naomi, an aspiring web developer passionate about building clean and simple web pages. I'm currently learning HTML and using it to create structured, responsive, and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>I'm excited to keep growing my skills and expand into CSS and JavaScript to bring more life and interactivity to my projects. I enjoy solving problems, learning new things, and turning ideas into functional web experiences.</p>

<p>This portfolio showcases some of my first steps in web development and I can't wait to see how far I'll go as I continue learning and creating.</p>
